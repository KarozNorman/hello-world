Hello Everyone!

My name is Karoz! Yes that's my real name!  
I'm a graphic designer who's trying to morph over into building websites. I Love designing book covers and boxing. I was actually good at Boxing at one point in my life being number 1 in the world. 
I was ranked number 1 in the world in 92, and Nationally ranked number 1 in 97 and 99. I graduated with my masters in Information Security 
Systems Management in 2017 and I'm still trying to persue that career. It's a tall mountain but I'm determined to climb it.
